## üèó Architecture & Trade-offs

### Component Structure
- **Spreadsheet.tsx** - Main spreadsheet component containing all functionality
- **Modular Design** - Separated concerns for cells, headers, and toolbar
- **Local State Management** - Used React's built-in state management for simplicity

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Custom Table Implementation** - Built a custom spreadsheet grid instead of using react-table for more control over cell interactions and styling

2. **Cell-based Data Structure** - Used a flat object structure with cell IDs as keys for efficient lookups and updates

3. **Inline Editing** - Implemented smooth transition between view and edit modes with proper focus management

4. **Responsive Grid** - Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for a responsive layout that works on all screen sizes

### Performance Considerations
- **Virtualization** - For large datasets, consider implementing virtual scrolling
- **Memoization** - Cell components could be memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Debounced Search** - Search functionality uses immediate updates (could be debounced for better performance)

## üé® Styling Approach

- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first approach for consistent styling
- **Component-based Classes** - Organized styles using the `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- **Hover States** - Interactive feedback for better user experience
- **Focus Management** - Proper focus indicators and keyboard navigation
